    <p>On the left is a red fox cranium, and on the right are the hipbones from the same fox.
      Obviously, I'm not totally sure, but I think that this red fox was an older adult female.
      You can see that the hipbones are conjoined, like I physically can't separate them.
      This is rather unusual, and I haven't seen it in any of my other specimens. After some light research,
      I found out that this fusion happens slowly overtime, which leads me to believe that this is an older,
      experienced fox. I also have another red fox skeleton that is <strong>considerably</strong>
      larger than this one, and since this fox is clearly not an adolescent and female red foxes are on
      average smaller than male red foxes, I deduced that this red fox was probably an older lady.
      And I love her <strong>very</strong> much.</p> <!-- paragraph explaing the pictures -->

    <p style="margin-right:15px">These are some teeth from a groundhog (I had just finished cleaning up the skeleton so that's why I'm wearing gloves).
    The long ones up top are the incisors. Groundhogs <strike>sometimes refered to as woodchucks but I think that sounds dumb</strike>
    are rodents, and a major component of being a part of the order <i>Rodentia</i> is having incisors that grow indefinitely.
    Rodents need to constantly use their incisors to grind them down, otherwise they can actually curl back up into their lips
    and harm them. These teeth slide back really far into the skull which allows for a lot of muscle connection to the jaw.
    That's why these rodents have really powerful bite forces, which helps them chew through tough vegetation. The other teeth
    here are molars, which are in the back of the mouth and used for grinding down plants even further. If you look closely, you
    might notice some brown and black discoloration. This is actually some tooth decay, which I find super interesting. Clearly,
    this groundhog was <strong>not</strong> brushing his teeth.</p>

    <p style="margin-left:15px">This is a raccoon baculum. And, um, so... hear me out... this is the penis bone. That's why I put it last, so only people
      who were actually interested in all of this would see it. So although it is kinda funny to think of the idea of a bone in
      the penis, they're actually really common in most mammals. They're even present in most primates, including our closest
      relative (the chimpanzee). So there is a lot of discussion in the scientific community on why humans don't have a baculum.
      As for the function of the baculum, it is obviously used in mating. It basically allows the male to mate for an extended
      period of time with a female because in the animal kingdom, females aren't always, let's say, <i>amenable</i> to mating.
      Pretty dark, I know. So their purpose in the animal kingdom is probably why humans eventually lost them! We enter long-term
      relationships with our partners and are very social and involved in parenting our children. So that's a very wholesome evolved
      trait, honestly. Humans are very lovey-dovey, so we don't have baculum. Anyway, this bone is one of my favorites because it
      was such a strange concept to me when I first found out about its existence. </p>

     It's a fun hobby of mine, and I appreciate anyone who has any interest in it <3</h3> <!-- the end -->
